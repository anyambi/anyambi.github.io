      <<h1><center>Get to know Me</center></h1>

      <p><h2><center>Hi my name is Anongka.I was born in 2004, August 2nd. i'm 15 yeas old going into the 10th grade. if i were to describe myself as a person it would be quiet and a bit shy, but around my friends; i could be quite obnoxious. i would have to say i'm an ambitrovert; i like to be by myself but sometimes being around my friends can be fun for me as well. the things i love to do is trying to learn how to code, which i have done this week and read books on my spare time, and the love of my life is my phone, im on that thing 24/7. now the things that i love are the office and tacos, oh yeah and of course my family as well.</center> </h2></p>

     <h1><center> My Future in STEM</center> </h1>
     <h2><center> The Begining</center> </h2>
    <p><center><h2> When i was little, i always wanted to be many things. As i grew up i started to understand, i liked to fix things; not big things but the little things. When it comes to a problems i always wanted to try to figure them out, even if it came to do it myself or to get help from others. At times i did give up, but that didnt mean i always gave up. Sometimes problem-solving can be fustrating but can be quite, a relief and exicement for yourself when you found the answer. My life and trying to figure out where i fit in, in STEM was a problem i needed to solve and that. i decied i wanted to become a Areospace engineer.
